	abstract = {This study addresses the performance of four-wheel-steering
                vehicles in high-speed lane change manoeuvres. The study
                compares the recorded steering command of an experienced driver
                in executing a lane change manoeuvre with that determined via
                solving a suitably formulated optimization problem.The study
                found them to be qualitatively comparable. This finding allows
                an analytical comparison of the optimal lane change performance
                achievable with both two and four-wheel-steering vehicles. For
                a representative high-speed lane change manoeuvre, the study
                revealed that, in the hands of an experienced driver, the
                performance benefit achievable with four-wheel-steering
                vehicles is not significant. This conclusion is in agreement
                with road test results obtained with two production
                four-wheel-steering vehicles. The applicability of the proposed
                ``optimal control'' approach in evaluating the performance of
                other driver-vehicle manoeuvres is an interesting topic for
                future study. (A) For the covering abstract of the conference

	abstract = {FOUR-WHEEL STEERING (4WS) is beginning to find widespread use
                as a new approach to improving vehicle dynamics, especially in
                the medium and high speed ranges. Steering the rear wheels in
                the same phase as the front wheels enhances vehicle stability.
                Four-wheel steering systems have an even greater potential to
                improve stability and steering response through suitable
                control over the transient characteristics of the rear wheel
                steer angle. This paper traces the course of Nissan research
                and development work on four-wheel steering and the evolution
                of Nissan's HICAS (4WS) technology. It also describes research
                activities under way on vehicle dynamics using a newly
                developed Simulator Vehicle, equipped with a front and rear
                angle transient control system which makes it possible to vary
                the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle instantaneously and

@article{Abe:1999aa,
	abstract = { AbstractRecent trends of vehicle chassis control are reviewed, paying attention to the basic nature of the vehicle dynamics, tyre characteristics and the effectiveness and limit of four-wheel steering (4WS) and direct yaw moment control (DYC). It is pointed out that, taking the non-linear characteristics of tyre and vehicle dynamics into consideration, change in chassis control from 4WS to DYC inevitably improves handling performance and active safety in vehicle motion with larger slip angles and/or higher lateral accelerations. Emphasis is placed on the need to propose a control strategy based on thorough observation and understanding of the tyre and vehicle dynamics. A side slip model following DYC by sliding control is introduced and the effects of the control are discussed. },

@inproceedings{NAGAI:2022aa,
	abstract = {In the 1980's, rear-wheel steering systems were widely spread among Japanese automobiles for improvement in making a small turn at a low velocity as a main purpose. However, almost all the rear-wheel steering systems disappeared due to high cost and unnatural feeling at the time of steering. Recently, the increasing number of manufactures adopt the rear-wheel steering systems for purposes of improving steering responsiveness and vehicle stability. However, it is strongly recognized that the unnatural feeling given to a driver, which is represented by ``teacup-ride like feeling'', during anti-phase steering at the low velocity is a characteristic of the rear wheel steering. In this study, control laws were developed with a side-slip angle and a yaw rate being set as target vehicle characteristics, and a large-angle rear-wheel steering system perfecting natural feeling and small-turn performance was developed.},

	abstract = { AbstractIn this paper, a lateral controller is designed for four-wheel steering (4WS) vehicles. The linear lateral dynamics of 4WS vehicles are deduced and then analysed, aided with three-dimensional graphs. To improve vehicle handling and stability at high speed, a multiobjective H ∞ optimal control algorithm is presented, while yaw rate is the only feedback signal. Simulation shows that the sideslip angle, yaw rate, and lateral acceleration of the 4WS vehicle follow and maintain preferable characteristics. The 4WS vehicle is agile and consistent with the steering input and does not understeer excessively. },
